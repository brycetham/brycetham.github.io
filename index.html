              <p class="lead text-muted">A virtual communication companion for children with autism.</p>
              <div class="project-description">
                <p>Over 20 million people worldwide suffer from autism, and many of these individuals struggle with everyday tasks such as communication, emotion identification, and learning. And while there is no cure for autism, it is possible to enhance the lives of those who have to live through this spectrum disorder.</p>
                <p>Bubble Buddle was created for the Autism App Jam co-hosted by Chapman University and UC Irvine. Following extensive interviews with those who work in the field of applied behavior analysis (ABA), Bubble Buddy was built from the ground up with children in mind. Each aspect of Bubble Buddy was created to address at least one of the 3 key issues related to autism and designed deliberately to adapt to their individual needs.</p>
                <p>Bubble Buddy took home 2 awards: the Hype Award for outstanding achievement in research and documentation, as well as 2nd place overall.</p>

              <h3>Elevate</h3>
              <p class="lead text-muted">A mobile web app that gives the formerly incarcerated a second chance.</p>
              <div class="project-description">
                <p>For the formerly incarcerated, finding a job can be especially difficult due to a variety of factors, including lack of technical literacy and negative social stigma towards ex-convicts. The unemployment rate of ex-offenders is 27%, only about 5% of recruiters actively consider ex-offenders, and 2 in 3 ex-offenders eventually get re-arrested.</p>
                <p>Elevate is a mobile web platform to help the formerly incarcerated navigate through the job application process from start to finish, from building a resume to applying for jobs. In collaboration with the Center for Employment Opportunities and the University of Southern Queensland, as well as financial backing from Stanford University and Oracle, we talked to dozens of currently and formerly incarcerated individuals and launched with over 900 unique visitors within the first week.</p>
                <p>At the Stanford Software Fair, Elevate took home prizes from Google, Facebook, and Palantir, as well as winning 1st place overall. The project also received multiple "best of" awards for user research.</p>

              <h3>IssueVoter</h3>
              <p class="lead text-muted">A web widget that gives voters a direct voice.</p>
              <div class="project-description">

                <p>Civic engagement in the United States has historically been low, even in today's age of interconnected technology. IssueVoter is a nonpartisan platform with a mission to give everyone a voice in our democracy by making civic engagement accessible, efficient, and impactful.</p>
                <p>Working with major news publishers such as Forbes and AP News, the IssueVoter widget allows people to conveniently communicate their stance on major political topics to their local representatives. By embedding the widget on any new article, it can intelligently determine the content of the article and match it with an upcoming bill to be voted on in Congress. With a click of a button, anyone can send their opinion of the bill to their representative.</p>
                <p>This project was presented at the "Using Tech for Good" showcase at Stanford University.</p>

              <h3>QuizBot</h3>
              <p class="lead text-muted">A chatbot to revolutionize knowledge-learning for students.</p>
              <div class="project-description">
                <p>Advances in conversational AI have the potential to enable more engaging and effective ways to teach factual knowledge. Traditional methods of learning can be inherently boring, and we have likely reached the limits as to how well these methods can perform.</p>
                <p>In a joint research venture between Stanford Interaction Design Lab and the TAL Education Group, we developed QuizBot, an AI-powered chatbot to help college students review questions through natural-language conversations. Our experimental results suggest that educational chatbot systems may have beneficial use, particularly for learning outside of traditional settings. QuizBot led to students recognizing (and recalling) over 20% more correct answers than when students used a flashcard app as well as significantly increased engagement levels.</p>
                <p>"QuizBot: A Dialogue-based Adaptive Learning System for Factual Knowledge" was presented at the 2019 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI).</p>

              <h3>The Smart Worker</h3>
              <p class="lead text-muted">An invaluable asset for the next generation of industry workers.</p>
              <div class="project-description">

                <p>The use of augmented reality (AR) applications has the potential to greatly reduce errors and increase productivity in the manufacturing space. In a technique called just-in-time augmented learning, "smart" workers can use AR to access valuable training resources, which play an important role in informing them of their tasks and responsibilities.</p>
                <p>As an honors researcher at the UC Irvine Institute for Software Research, the Smart Worker is a software solution that focuses on the problem of how to provide effective training using AR. Additional funding and guidance was provided by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2).</p>
                <p>The Smart Worker was presented at the 2017 UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium and the 2017 ISR Research Forum as well as to industry partners of the university.</p>
