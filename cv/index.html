        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in conversational AI have the potential to enable more engaging and effective ways to teach factual knowledge. To investigate this hypothesis, we created QuizBot, a dialogue-based agent that helps students learn factual knowledge in science, safety, and English vocabulary. We evaluated QuizBot with 76 students through two within-subject studies against a flashcard app, the traditional medium for learning factual knowledge. Though both systems used the same algorithm for sequencing materials, QuizBot led to students recognizing (and recalling) over 20% more correct answers than when students used the flashcard app. Using a conversational agent is more time consuming to practice with; but in a second study, of their own volition, students spent 2.6x more time learning with QuizBot than with flashcards and reported preferring it strongly for casual learning. Our results in this second study showed QuizBot yielded improved learning gains over flashcards on recall. These results suggest that educational chatbot systems may have beneficial use, particularly for learning outside of traditional settings.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The use of augmented reality (AR) applications has the potential to greatly reduce errors and increase productivity in the manufacturing space. The application I developed, in particular, focuses on the problem of how to provide effective training, which refers to issues that are related to when workers are required to learn new or updated skills, using AR. In a technique called just-in-time augmented learning, these “smart" workers can use AR to access valuable training resources, which play an important role in informing them of their tasks and responsibilities. This can be done without the need to refer to a secondary laptop computer or tablet, because the resources are loaded directly onto the workers’ AR device, integrating the training process into the workflow and reducing diversion. By using various game-based systems and marker-based AR libraries, I designed and developed a prototype for a head-mounted AR application that demonstrates the feasibility of just-in-time augmented learning for use in the assembly line manufacturing context.</p>

        <p class="lead">Circle K International</p>
        <p>The primary source of my community service experience comes from my involvement in Circle K International as an event chair for various projects and fundraisers as well as an appointed board member, family head, and mentor. My over 750 hours of involvement have accrued me <a href="http://www.cnhcirclek.org/leadership/membership-recognition-program/">bronze and silver membership recognition standing</a> over the course of my 4 years of service both at UCI and Stanford. Notably, I am the co-founder of <a href="http://ctg.ucicirclek.com">Change Thru Games</a>, an annual video game marathon that has raised thousands of dollars for various charities.</p>
